# ChoirApp UI/UX Improvement Plan
## Comprehensive Frontend Enhancement Strategy

### **Project Overview**
ChoirApp is a digital platform for choir management that helps administrators manage choirs, songs, playlists, and members. The current application uses React with TypeScript, Bulma CSS framework, and has a functional but basic UI that needs significant enhancement for better user experience.

## **Current State Analysis**

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **CSS Framework**: Bulma 1.0.4
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.3.5
- **Additional Libraries**: React Router, React DatePicker, Axios

### **Current UI Issues Identified**
1. **Basic Design**: Simple, utilitarian design lacking modern aesthetics
2. **Limited Visual Hierarchy**: Poor use of typography and spacing
3. **Inconsistent Styling**: Mix of Bulma classes and custom SCSS
4. **No Brand Identity**: Generic appearance without distinctive visual identity
5. **Mobile Experience**: Needs responsive design improvements
6. **User Flow**: Navigation and information architecture could be streamlined
