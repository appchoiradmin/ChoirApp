ChoirApp: A Product Vision and Blueprint for Collaborative Choir Management
1.0 Executive Summary: ChoirApp at a Glance
ChoirApp is a digital tool for church choirs to manage songs and create playlists for events like services or practices [UQ_1]. It centralizes musical content, allowing members to view synchronized lyrics and chords on mobile devices during performances [UQ_2]. The app offers flexible playlist tools for various organizational needs [UQ_14], targeting choir members, administrators, and general users interested in a master song database [UQ_7]. It features a mobile-first design for live use and a responsive desktop interface for preparation [UQ_2, UQ_3].

2.0 The "Why": Problem & Opportunity
2.1 Challenges Faced by Church Choir Members
Church choirs face operational challenges: dispersed song management (inconsistent versions, poor accessibility), inefficient playlist preparation (manual, time-consuming, repetitive for recurring events), synchronization issues during performance (difficulty tracking lyrics/chords live [UQ_2]), and lack of centralized information (scattered member/schedule data [UQ_11]).

2.2 Market Opportunity for a Dedicated Tool
Church choirs are an underserved market needing digital solutions. ChoirApp's flexible playlist customization [UQ_14] and new playlist templates offer broad appeal beyond churches, reducing manual inefficiencies like printing and version errors. Its mobile-first design [UQ_2] makes it a strategic, cost-saving tool. The ability for choirs to save custom song versions [UQ_17] and share public/private playlists [UQ_19] fosters a unique musical archive and community learning, transforming the app into a platform for cultural exchange.

3.0 The "What": Core Product Concept & Functionality
3.1 Core Purpose
ChoirApp is a centralized, collaborative platform for church choir members to manage songs and create/share performance-ready playlists [UQ_1].

3.2 Key Functionality Overview
ChoirApp offers: Google-based sign-up, choir creation/admin roles, member invitation/removal [UQ_4, UQ_5, UQ_6, UQ_9, UQ_10]. Access to a master song list in ChordPro CSV format [UQ_7, UQ_16]. Choirs can save edited song versions, keeping originals intact and private to the choir [UQ_17]. Dynamic playlist creation with configurable sections [UQ_12, UQ_13, UQ_14], uniquely identified by date/time and choir ID [UQ_15]. New: Playlist templates for reusable structures (e.g., "Mass parts"), with dedicated management. Mobile-first view for synchronized lyrics/chords during performances [UQ_2]. Robust tagging for songs/playlists with a non-duplicating, lowercase tag manager [UQ_18, UQ_19]. Playlist discovery (personal/public) [UQ_20]. Super admin oversight [UQ_21]. This ensures a single source of truth for songs [UQ_16, UQ_2], balancing universal content with choir autonomy [UQ_17, UQ_19].

3.3 Platform & Design Philosophy
ChoirApp's design prioritizes practical utility: Mobile-First for live performance access to lyrics/chords [UQ_2], Responsive Desktop Support for admin/editing [UQ_3], and an Intuitive UI for all users.

4.0 The "For Whom": Target Users & Their Journeys
4.1 User Personas
4.1.1 Choir Admin
A Choir Admin signs up via Google, creates a unique choir [UQ_4], and manages it. They invite/remove members [UQ_6, UQ_9, UQ_10], oversee the dashboard [UQ_11], create playlists (public/private) [UQ_19], and now, create/manage playlist templates for recurring events. Value: streamlined admin, centralized management, consistent musical activities.

4.1.2 Choir Member
A Choir Member is invited by an Admin. They view shared playlists, lyrics, and chords on mobile during performances [UQ_2]. They can edit/save choir-specific song versions [UQ_17], create playlists, and now, create/use playlist templates. Needs: seamless access, clear display, contribution to adaptations, dashboard navigation [UQ_11]. Value: unified digital sheet music, enhanced synchronization, shared musical resources.

4.1.3 General User
A General User signs up via Google but doesn't join a choir [UQ_8]. They access the master song database [UQ_7, UQ_16] and public playlists [UQ_20]. Value: free resource for musical exploration. This tiered access model offers basic content freely, driving adoption, while collaborative features require choir participation.

4.1.4 Super Admin (Product Owner)
The Super Admin has ultimate control over all choirs and app details [UQ_21]. Critical for oversight, troubleshooting, and guiding development. Needs: comprehensive monitoring, intervention capabilities, and data access for product evolution. This role ensures platform stability and strategic direction. ChoirApp reinforces choir identity through unique names [UQ_5], choir IDs for playlists [UQ_15], and choir-specific song editing [UQ_17], fostering belonging and engagement.

4.2 User Needs & Value Proposition
Choir Admins: Streamlined setup, member/content control, efficient playlist/template orchestration.

Choir Members: Real-time synchronized lyrics/chords [UQ_2], collaborative song adaptation, efficient playlist setup via templates.

General Users: Free access to master songs/public playlists, fostering engagement.

Super Admin: Full oversight, ensuring app health and strategic growth.
