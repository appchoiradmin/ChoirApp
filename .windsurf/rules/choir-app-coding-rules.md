We have a monorepo where we have frontend and backend in the same repo.
We must try to implement Unit tests and integration tests to have complete coverage.
Always follow best practices in terms of architecture, scalability and testability.

For the backend project:
- Follow a Clean Architecture with DDD, REPR pattern and Result pattern
