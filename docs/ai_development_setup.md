# AI Development Environment Setup

This document provides instructions for setting up the AI-powered development environment for the ChoirApp project.

## Step 1.3.3: Windsurf Integration

Windsurf is the primary AI platform for ChoirApp development, chosen for its comprehensive support for the entire software engineering lifecycle. It offers advanced reasoning capabilities to accelerate development, from generating component structures and styling to converting designs into code.

Since you are developing within the Windsurf IDE, the Windsurf AI assistant is already integrated and active. There are no additional installation steps required. You are already interacting with it to build this application. This direct integration is a key part of our strategy to streamline development and enhance productivity.

## Step 1.3.4: Explore SQLAI.ai

SQLAI.ai is a powerful tool for generating and optimizing SQL queries. It will be instrumental in designing the database schema and ensuring efficient data access for our PostgreSQL database.

Please familiarize yourself with its capabilities by visiting the website:
